### Purpose

[![Hourly build](https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisoriesBuilder/workflows/Hourly%20build/badge.svg?branch=latest)](https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisoriesBuilder/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Hourly+build%22)

This package ensures that your application doesn't have installed dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.

## Installation

```sh
composer require --dev roave/security-advisories:dev-latest
```

## Usage

This package does not provide any API or usable classes: its only purpose is to prevent installation of software
with known and documented security issues.
Simply add `"roave/security-advisories": "dev-latest"` to your `composer.json` `"require-dev"` section and you will
not be able to harm yourself with software with known security vulnerabilities.

For example, try following:

```sh
composer require --dev roave/security-advisories:dev-latest
# following commands will fail:
composer require symfony/symfony:2.5.2
composer require zendframework/zendframework:2.3.1 
```

The checks are only executed when adding a new dependency via `composer require` or when running `composer update`:
deploying an application with a valid `composer.lock` and via `composer install` won't trigger any security versions
checking.

 > You can manually trigger a version check by using the `--dry-run` switch on an update while not doing anything. Running `composer update --dry-run roave/security-advisories` is an effective way to manually trigger a security version check.

You can also contact us at team@roave.com for looking into security issues in your own project.

## Stability

This package can only be required in its `dev-latest` version: there will never be stable/tagged versions because of
the nature of the problem being targeted. Security issues are in fact a moving target, and locking your project to a 
specific tagged version of the package would not make any sense.

This package is therefore only suited for installation in the root of your deployable project.

## Sources

This package extracts information about existing security issues in various composer projects from 
the [FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories) repository and the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer).
